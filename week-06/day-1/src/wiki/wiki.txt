Origins
The first aviation film was the 1911 William J. Humphrey–directed two-reeler, The Military Air-Scout,[1] shot following an Aero Club of America flying meet at Long Island, New York, with Lt. Henry Arnold doing the stunt flying. "Arnold, who picked up 'a few extra bucks' for his services, became so excited about movies that he almost quit the Army to become an actor."[2]

The years between World War I and World War II saw extensive use of the new technology, aircraft, in the new medium, film.[3] In the early 1920s Hollywood studios made dozens of now-obscure "aerial Westerns" with leads such as Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson, where the role of the horse was taken by aircraft, or used aircraft as nothing more than vehicles for stunts to excite audiences.[4] In 1926 the first "proper" aviation film was made; Wings is a story of two pilots who sign up to fly and fight in The Great War.[5] Made with the co-operation of the United States' then-Department of War (a relationship that continues to this day), it used front-line military aircraft of the day such as the Thomas-Morse MB-3 and Boeing PW-9, flown by military pilots.[6][7] Future US Air Force Generals Hap Arnold and Hoyt Vandenberg were among the military officers involved with the production, Arnold as a technical consultant and Vandenberg as one of the pilots.[8] Wings was a box-office hit when it achieved general release in 1929 and went on to win the award for Best Production at the first Academy Awards.[9][10]

In Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed films were used as propaganda tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad.[11] One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via Mussolini's son Vittorio, who was the driving force behind the film's production.[12] The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was used to compare the allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s.[13] However, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media.[12] For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura ("Aeropainting").[14] While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura – namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight – the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered.[14][15]

In the US the use or denial of use of current military aircraft in films is determined by the US military itself. The armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the US military in a positive light. Because alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get US military approval often do not get financed or made. Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com concluded of this problem, "This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship...If the government wants to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism. The Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military's reputation and recruiting efforts. These concerns are legitimate, but it's more important that we allow John Stuart Mill's 'market place of ideas' to be a place for free trade, rather than favoring some over others."[16]

Since the advent of television, aircraft have been featured in numerous miniseries and series around the world. These include the American productions Twelve O'Clock High, Airwolf, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Sky King and Wings; the Australian series Big Sky, Chopper Squad and The Flying Doctors, and the miniseries The Lancaster Miller Affair; British shows such as Airline, Piece of Cake and Squadron, the Canadian series Arctic Air; JETS – Leben am Limit and Medicopter 117 – Jedes Leben zählt from Germany; and the Canadian–British–German co-production Ritter's Cove.

A-1 Skyraider
In the 1953 James A. Michener novel The Bridges at Toko-Ri a number of Douglas AD-1 Skyraiders fly RESCAP missions over a downed Grumman F9F Panther and Sikorsky HO3S-1 during the Korean War. This is also the case in the 1954 film of the same name.[17]

A flight of US Navy AD-1s stood in for unavailable Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in the 1962 production The Longest Day,[18] based on the Cornelius Ryan non-fiction book of the same title.

The A-1 Skyraider made appearances in the 1968 film The Green Berets, loosely based on the 1965 book of the same name by Robin Moore.[18]

"Sandy" combat search and rescue missions were depicted in the 1991 John Milius film Flight of the Intruder based on the Stephen Coonts novel of the same title.[18]

The Skyraider was also featured as one of the many aircraft providing close air support during the First Battle of the Ia Drang Valley Campaign in Mel Gibson's 2002 film We Were Soldiers,[18][19] based on the non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once… And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway.

CGI-rendered US Navy Skyraiders were shown in the 2007 Werner Herzog film Rescue Dawn, set during the Vietnam War.[18]

A-4 Skyhawk
Two Douglas A-4 Skyhawks were featured as aggressor aircraft during the training sequences in the 1986 film Top Gun.[20] Producers reimbursed the US Navy $8,600 an hour for flight time used in the film.[21]

An A-4 Ayit from the Israeli Air Force is featured in the opening scene of the 2002 Paramount Pictures film The Sum of All Fears.[22]

A-6 Intruder
The 1986 Stephen Coonts novel Flight of the Intruder centers around two naval aviators during the Vietnam War who take their Grumman A-6 Intruder on an unauthorized bombing raid on Hanoi. It was made into a 1991 film of the same name.[23]

The A-6 was also featured in the 1990 video game, Flight of the Intruder, and the Flight of the Intruder's 1995 sequel, The Intruders.[24]

A-10 Thunderbolt II

A-10 Thunderbolt II
The evil Gobots character Bad Boy and the heroic Transformers character Powerglide both disguise themselves as Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt IIs.[25]

The popularity of the A-10s in the 2007 Transformers film led to the toy company releasing a minor character named Wingblade that turned into an A-10.[26][27]

The A-10 is one of the player-flyable aircraft in the 1989 video game U.N. Squadron.[28] The aircraft is also featured in the 1989 video game A-10 Tank Killer.[29] Since then, it has made appearances in the Ace Combat series.[30]

In the 1996 film Courage Under Fire, A-10s are depicted dropping napalm on the crash site of two downed Huey helicopters after their crews were recovered, and briefly depicted during an account given by a survivor.[31]

A-10s were also featured in the 2005 film Jarhead, where they attack US Marine forces in a friendly fire incident.[32]

In the 2009 film Terminator Salvation, several A-10s are sent to support the ground troops led by John Connor in the opening sequence of the film. Later, two Resistance A-10s are shot down when trying to intercept the machine transport in which Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese were captive.[33][34]

Three A-10s using the call sign "Thunder" are sent to Smallville to kill both Superman and General Zod and his henchmen in the 2013 film Man of Steel but are attacked by Zod's forces, resulting in the destruction of two of the jets.[35]

A-26/B-26 Invader
B-26 Invaders (post-war designation) appeared in the 1956 novel Turn the Tigers Loose by Colonel Walter D. Lasly which depicted night-bombing operations during the Korean War.[36]

French Armée de l'Air Douglas A-26 Invaders appeared in the 1964 John Frankenheimer film The Train as Allied aircraft bombing a railroad yard.[37]

Two A-26 firebombers were prominently featured in the 1989 Steven Spielberg film, Always.[38] The flying for the film was performed by well-known film pilot Steve Hinton[39] and Dennis Lynch,[40] the owners of the A-26s. Attempts to use radio-controlled models for special effects shots were abandoned as unworkable and models "flown" from wire rigs were utilized instead.[41]

A6M Zero
The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was featured in the films The Final Countdown,[42] Pearl Harbor,[43][44] and Tora! Tora! Tora!.[45] The Zero was also depicted in the 1976 film Midway; however real Zeros were not used. Modified T-6 Texans were used in both Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway to depict A6M2 Type 21 Zero fighters, and some footage from the former was reused in the latter.[46][47][48] Three Type 52 Zeros were used in Pearl Harbor. Two restored aircraft operated by Flight Magic, and one in the Planes of Fame Air Museum collection were barged to Hawaii where "all three aircraft were extensively flown with few problems until NX6528L suffered a gear-up landing. Fortunately, this was near the end of filming. NX6528L was shipped to Pete Regina Aviation at Van Nuys where it was returned to flying condition. This aircraft is now with the Commemorative Air Force Southern California Wing at Camarillo Airport."[49][50]

The A5M and A6M are both featured in The Wind Rises, a 2013 Studio Ghibli animated fictionalized biopic of Zero designer Jiro Horikoshi.[51]

A modified Gazelle was used as a light attack helicopter in the 1988 Sylvester Stallone film, Rambo III. The helicopter was shot down by the main character.[57]

Aérospatiale Puma
Modified Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas were used to depict Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships, in the films Red Dawn, Rambo: First Blood Part II, and Rambo III, in 1984, 1985 and 1988, respectively.[57][58][59]

The AH-64 also made an appearance in the 1991 film Toy Soldiers.[69]

An AH-64 was used to attempt to suppress the Hulk in the 2008 film, The Incredible Hulk. Although it has the standard, nose mounted M230 Chain Gun, it instead attacks with the unusual configuration of twin, pylon-mounted miniguns.[70]

In the 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Apaches provide air cover for a convoy carrying nanotechnology-based weapons.[71]

Airbus A320
An Airbus A320 aircraft appeared in the 2016 Clint Eastwood film, Sully: Miracle on the Hudson. The film is based on the true story of how Capt.

An Avro 504 also appears in the 1976 British war film Aces High, being used for photo reconnaissance, a role in which the aircraft was widely used.[83] Directed by Jack Gold and starred Malcolm McDowell, Peter Firth, Christopher Plummer and Simon Ward, the screenplay was written by Howard Barker. As acknowledged in the opening credits, the film is based on the 1930s play Journey's End by R. C. Sherriff and the 1936 memoir Sagittarius Rising by Cecil Lewis of the Royal Flying Corps. It tells the story of an RFC squadron in the First World War and the high turnover of pilots and the strain on the survivors and includes aerial dogfight scenes.[84]

Avro Anson

This Avro Anson was used in the Australian television miniseries The Great Air Race as a "stand-in" to represent the Boeing 247 flown by Roscoe Turner in the MacRobertson Air Race.
An Avro Anson was used as a "stand-in" to represent the Boeing 247 Race 57 flown in the 1934 England-to-Australia MacRobertson Air Race by Roscoe Turner, in the 1991 Australian television miniseries The Great Air Race.[85] Turner was played by Barry Bostwick in the miniseries.

Avro Ashton
An Avro Ashton, in its six-engined, Olympus testbed form appeared as the fictitious Phoenix airliner in Cone of Silence (1960), based on the novel of the same name[86] by David Beaty, a former BOAC pilot. This concerned the takeoff problems of the Phoenix, and the subsequent accident investigation; it was based on two takeoff accidents to the de Havilland Comet.[87][88]

Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow
The Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow makes a prominent appearance in Daniel Wyatt's 1990 novel, The Last Flight of the Arrow. In the novel, the real-life destruction of the fighter is a cover for a secret US-Canadian continental air-defense initiative that fields a fleet of Arrows. A Polish-Canadian Royal Canadian Air Force pilot flies one Arrow on a high-speed reconnaissance flight over Russia to find proof that the Soviet Union is planning an airstrike on North America.[89]

In 1997, the CBC broadcast The Arrow miniseries. The production used a combination of archival film, remote-control flying models and computer animation for the static, ground and flying sequences. The film won numerous awards, including the Gemini that year.[90]

Avro Lancaster

Avro Lancaster
The Avro Lancaster was perhaps the most well-known and successful Royal Air Force heavy bomber of World War II.[91] As such it has appeared in many works of fiction related to Bomber Command and its night raids over Germany and occupied Europe.

Lancasters appeared in the 1952 British war film Appointment in London (released in the US as Raiders in the Sky) directed by Philip Leacock and starring Dirk Bogarde.[92] Three Lancasters were used in the production—NX673, NX679 and NX782, the same three that were used in the filming of The Dam Busters three years later.[93]

The Lancaster was central to the second half of the 1955 British film The Dam Busters. This is a dramatisation of the real-life Operation Chastise, which included the forming of No. 617 Squadron RAF commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), and the bombing of the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe Dams in Germany to interrupt water and hydro-electric power supplies to German munitions factories.[94] The film is based on the books The Dam Busters by Paul Brickhill and Enemy Coast Ahead by Guy Gibson. A number of B VII Lancasters in storage were modified to the original configuration of the B III (Special) for use on screen.[95]

The Lancaster also appeared in The Guns of Navarone (1961).[96]

A 1989 British commercial for Carling Black Label lager reused Avro Lancaster footage in a Dam Busters parody sequence where a German soldier on top of a dam catches the Lancaster's bombs like a football goalkeeper. The pilot of the attacking Lancaster then delivers the brand slogan: "I bet he drinks Carling Black Label!" The commercial ran for many years, frequently appearing in commercial breaks during broadcasts of both The Dam Busters and documentaries about Operation Chastise.[97]

Len Deighton's 1970 novel Bomber describes an attack by Royal Air Force Lancasters on Krefeld, Germany, during which a series of unplanned incidents leads to the carpet bombing of a small town nearby.[98]

The Avro Lancaster was also featured in the UK television series Pathfinders, airing in 1972 and released on DVD in 2006, concentrating on the lives of the aircrew of a fictional Pathfinder squadron during the Second World War.[99]

Lancasters appear in a sequence depicting the bombing of Dresden in World War II in the 1992 film Map of the Human Heart directed by Vincent Ward.[100] For the production, a mock-up cockpit section of a Lancaster was constructed and was later displayed at the Bomber Command Museum in Canada.[101]

Vintage Lancaster NX611 appeared in the 2002 BBC mini-series Night Flight (also released as Night and Day) which featured Christopher Plummer and Edward Woodward as two ageing veterans of Bomber Command who are haunted by the memories of their experiences.[102]

Lancasters feature in the 2011 novel Dambuster by Robert Radcliffe.[103]

The 2019 budget independent film Lancaster Skies (also titled Our Shining Sword) centres on a loner who takes over as leader of a Lancaster crew.[104]

Avro Vulcan
See also: Fictional military aircraft § Vindicator
The Avro Vulcan enjoyed generous screen time in the James Bond film Thunderball (1965).[105]

Vulcans are the central feature of the 2008 aviation novel by English author Derek Robinson, titled Hullo Russia, Goodbye England. A British RAF pilot named Silk, a veteran of Bomber Command in the Second World War, rejoins the service at the height of the Cold War.[106]

B-1 Lancer
The Transformers Decepticon named Windsweeper disguises itself as a B-1 Lancer.[107]

A B-1B Lancer drops numerous bombs during the climactic battle scene in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[108]

A B-1 bomber launches AGM-86 missiles in Never Say Never Again.[109][110][111]

In the film, Real Genius, a B-1B, with a fictional 5 megawatt laser weapon installed in the bomb bay, is reprogrammed to fire at a house filled with unpopped popcorn at the film's climax.[112]

B-2 Spirit
Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit was featured in the 1996 20th Century Fox film Independence Day.[113] B-2 spirit deploys the nuclear missile at the saucer over Houston but fails because the saucer has a deflector shield.

The B-2 Spirit appeared in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears, based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name.[114]

In the 2008 film Cloverfield, a B-2 drops a payload on the monster that is the antagonist in the film.[115]

A pair of B-2 bombers, identified onscreen as being from the 509th Operations Group, are sent by the US to attack the titular monster in the 2016 film Shin Godzilla.[116]

B-17 Flying Fortress

Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress
The first appearance of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in film was a Y1B-17 in the 1938 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) production Test Pilot, although for the crash scene a Douglas DC-2 was modified to stand in for the bomber, the Army Air Corps being unwilling to risk even having a fire lit next to the scarce type for filming.[117]

B-17Bs of the 132nd Bomb Squadron, 9th Bomb Group from March Field, California ("Land of the Flying Fortress") were featured in the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings, based on the novel of the same title by 1st Lt. Beirne Lay, Jr..[17]

The self-explanatory 1942 Warner Bros. film Flying Fortress showed Royal Air Force Fortress I bombers, singly, and in formation.[118]

B-17s appear in the 1943 RKO picture Bombardier, at Kirtland Field, New Mexico.[119]

The 1943 Warner Bros. film Air Force, directed by Howard Hawks, used at least nine B-17B, C and D model Flying Fortresses to depict the early years of World War II, including the attack on Pearl Harbor.[120]

In William Wyler's 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives, B-17s are prominently featured. The primary male characters hitch a cross country ride in a B-17E Flying Fortress early in the story, and at the conclusion the scrapyard at Chino, California is shown full of disposal B-17s and YB-40 gunship versions of the B-17.[121]

B-17s also figured prominently in the Oscar-winning 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High starring Gregory Peck. The film concerns aviation leadership and the human toll in the USAAF strategy of daylight precision bombing.[122] The US Air Force cooperated in the production of the film, lending aircraft to the producers and allowing filming at Eglin Air Force Base and at Ozark Army Air Field.[123] The film featured an actual crash landing of a B-17, piloted by veteran stunt pilot Paul Mantz.[124]

The other post-war (1948) film about early 8th Air Force bomber operations, MGM's Command Decision, with Clark Gable and Walter Pidgeon, relied primarily on combat footage of Flying Fortresses, although at least one B-17F and one B-17G were utilized for ground filming in California.[125]

B-17s feature in the 1951 novel The Sun is Silent by Saul Levitt which traces the journey of a B-17 crew from their training through to their daylight bombing missions over Germany. The author himself had served as a radioman/gunner in a B-17 during the war.[126]

For the 1954 Universal International Pictures film The Glenn Miller Story, directed by Anthony Mann, a wartime performance set in a U.K. air base hangar was shot in Hangar No. 1 at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, on 10 July 1953, with the late-production B-17G command aircraft of Gen. John G. Sprague, commanding officer of Lowry, as a backdrop. It received a wartime coat of olive drab paint for the appearance, but the chin turret was removed. Anachronistic B-29 engine cowlings line the back wall of the hangar, although B-29s were not used in the ETO.[127]

A US Coast Guard PB-1G "Dumbo", rescue variant of the B-17, carrying an A-1 lifeboat, was shown in the 1954 film The High and the Mighty, based on the Ernest K. Gann novel of the same name.[128]

The 1958 Universal International Pictures love triangle film The Lady Takes a Flyer about a woman involved with two pilots who trade in war-surplus aircraft, featured at least two B-17s.[129]

One ex-USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress and two ex-US Navy PB-1W Flying Fortresses were retrieved from a boneyard, restored, and flown across the Atlantic Ocean for the making of the 1962 Columbia Pictures film The War Lover, based on a John Hersey novel of the same title.[130]

A B-17G operated by Intermountain Airlines, an actual Central Intelligence Agency front company, fitted with the Fulton recovery system, drops rescue gear to James Bond and his Bond girl in the Bahamas at the conclusion of the 1965 film Thunderball. This aircraft had actually been used by the CIA to insert and recover agents in the Arctic that had checked on an abandoned Soviet ice station under Project COLDFEET in 1963.[131]

Two DB-17P former drone-controllers and one B-17F were featured in the 1969 film The Thousand Plane Raid.[132] One of the DB-17Ps briefly appeared in the biopic MacArthur in 1977, still wearing the same markings and paint it had for The Thousand Plane Raid.[133]

Five flyable B-17s were secured by producer Elmo Williams for use in the filming of the 1970 motion picture Tora! Tora! Tora!. During filming, one B-17 suffered a malfunction in its landing gear, forcing it to land on one wheel. Williams ordered a camera crew to film the landing and incorporated the footage into the film's script.[134]

The 1972 novel The Silver Lady by James Facos is about a B-17 crew working together and trying to survive its 25-mission tour.[135]

The "Pacific Pearl", an ill-fated B-17, is the setting of one segment of the 1981 animated film Heavy Metal.[136]

The B-17 Flying Fortress was the subject of the 1990 Warner Bros. film Memphis Belle.[137] During filming, one of the five vintage B-17s was destroyed in an accidental crash and a second was damaged when an engine cowling detached in flight, tearing a chunk out of the aircraft's tail (and narrowly missing a nearby P-51). There were no injuries in either incident.[138]

B-17s are the main aircraft featured in two novels depicting fictional characters in the US daylight bombing offensive over Germany and Occupied Europe, American writer Sam Helpert's A Real Good War (1997)[139] and UK author Robert Radcliffe's Under an English Heaven (2004).[140]

For George Lucas' 2012 film Red Tails about the 332d Fighter Group, the Tuskegee Airmen, the B-17G "Pink Lady" operated by the Association Forteresse Toujours Volante, appeared as a 351st Bomb Group aircraft named "Yankee", coded ED-N. Filmed in the Czech Republic in 2010, the film company funding allowed the warbird to fly for an additional year before being retired to museum status. Other Flying Fortresses were rendered through CGI.[141]

B-17s feature in the 2014 graphic novel mini-series Castles in the Sky, published by Avatar, written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Matt Martin & Keith Burns. The story features a gunner named Leonard Wetmore who is one of the crew of the B-17 'Buffalo Gal' during the US daylight bombing offensive against Germany. The story was one of Ennis' War Stories series.[142]

B-18 Bolo

Douglas B-18 Bolo
Douglas B-18 Bolos appeared in scenes for the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings, based on the novel of the same title by 1st Lt. Beirne Lay, Jr..[17]

B-18 Bolos are prominently featured in the 1943 RKO picture Bombardier, filmed at Kirtland Field, New Mexico.[119]

B-24 Liberator
A Consolidated B-24 Liberator was featured in the 1977 Telemovie Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy.[143]

The novel Face of a Hero (1950) tells the story of a B-24 crew operating from an airport in Apulia, Italy, in 1944; it is based on the real experiences of its author, Louis Falstein, who had been a tail gunner on a USAAF B-24. The novel describes in detail the raids of the B-24 bombers on Romania, Yugoslavia, northern Italy, southern France, and Germany.[144]

B-24s are a central feature in the 1952 novel Angle of Attack by Joseph Landon. The story centres around a navigator Irwin 'Win' Hellman whose B-24 is attacked by enemy fighters and badly damaged over Vienna. The B-24's pilot signals to the enemy fliers that he wishes to surrender but Hellman, who is Jewish and dreads being captured alive, believes they can still escape and, with the backing of the other crew, he takes command.[145]

B-24s also feature in the 1957 novel The Damned Wear Wings by David Camerer, a work that portrays B-24s of the 473rd Bomb Group based in Italy tasked with bombing the oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania.[146]

The story of the "Lady Be Good" inspired a 1970 television movie titled Sole Survivor, with a North American B-25 Mitchell playing the B-24D role.[147]

In the young adult novel Under a War-Torn Sky, the main character Henry Forester co-pilots Out of the Blue, a US B-24 Liberator serving in the Royal Air Force.[148]

The B-24 is featured in the classic novel Goodbye to Some by Gordon Forbes, a former pilot, who seems to know the foibles of the aircraft. Of special note is the characteristic "siphoning" during flight of fuel from the tanks in the wings, caused by a venturi effect of air passing over the wings, sometimes resulting in a mid-air explosion of the aircraft.[149]

B-24s feature in the 1979 novel The White Sea Bird by David Beaty, a story about an RAF bomber unit whose commander becomes obsessed with hunting a German surface raider lurking in a secret base in a Norwegian Fjord and menacing Allied convoys at sea.[150]

The episode "King Nine Will Not Return" of television series The Twilight Zone was based on the "Lady Be Good", a Consolidated B-24 Liberator whose wreckage had been discovered in November 1958, and used a B-25 in place of the B-24. It first aired 30 September 1960.[154]

A B-25 features in the 1965 World War II film In Harm's Way directed by Otto Preminger and starring John Wayne and Kirk Douglas.[155]

The Sole Survivor, a 1970 telemovie, was also based loosely on the "Lady Be Good", and also featured a B-25 in the Liberator role. It first aired 9 January 1970.[156]

The B-25 is featured in the 1970 Mike Nichols film Catch-22, which had 17 film unit B-25s in flying condition.[157] Like the Battle of Britain's resurrection and ultimate preservation of German and British aviation combatants, the Catch-22 air force helped form a nucleus of the nascent warbirds movement. Fifteen of the 18 bombers used in the film still remain intact, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.[158]

B-25s feature in the 1976 novel Whip by Martin Caidin, which portrays a B-25 unit based in Australia and commanded by Captain 'Whip' Russell and they are employed in low-level bombing missions against Japanese convoys carrying reinforcements to Guadalcanal and Rabaul in 1942.[159][160]

The B-25 was the focus of the second half of the 2001 film Pearl Harbor, although critics complained that the bomber and its role were being depicted inaccurately.[161]

A B-25 is used in the 2011 film Sucker Punch.[162]

B-25s appear in the 2019 Hulu mini-series Catch-22 directed by George Clooney.[163] Two vintage B-25s were used in the production[164] and other B-25s were re-created with CGI.[165]

B-29s feature in the 1951 novel Don't Touch Me by Mackinlay Kantor which depicted a B-29 unit based in Nyoka air-base, Japan and tasked with flying bombing missions to Korea.[168]

The first Hollywood retelling of the 509th Composite Group's preparation for the atomic missions was Above and Beyond, released by MGM in 1953, with Robert Taylor portraying Col. Paul Tibbetts, and Jim Backus as Gen. Curtis LeMay. Filmed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.[169]

A B-29 features in the 1954 Cold War drama Hell and High Water directed by Samuel Fuller and starring Richard Widmark. The film's plot concerns a plan by the Chinese to use a captured B-29 to launch an atomic strike on Korea and then let the US take the blame for it.[170]

B-29s feature in the 1956 novel Roll Back the Sky by Ward Taylor which portrayed B-29 crews bombing Japan during 1945.[171]

The B-29 also played the titular role in the 1980 Disney film The Last Flight of Noah's Ark.[172]

Film makers also used the only B-29 still flying in 1983 in the film The Right Stuff to recreate the launch of the Bell X-1 for the first supersonic flight.[173]

The B-29 Superfortress is seen in the movie Empire of the Sun.[174]

B-36 Peacemaker

Convair B-36
The Convair B-36 featured prominently in Paramount's 1955 film Strategic Air Command starring James Stewart, who plays a World War II bomber pilot and member of the Air Force Reserve and is forced to crash land in the Arctic. The film features many good aerial shots of B-36s and was primarily filmed at Carswell AFB, Texas, and MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida, and Al Lang Field in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida. One particularly difficult shot was that of Stewart's character, a baseball player, standing on the baseball field at Al Lang Field while a B-36 flies overhead and casts a shadow over him, foreshadowing his imminent recall to active service.[175]

The B-36 also appeared in the 1957 Howard Hughes film Jet Pilot, which starred John Wayne and Janet Leigh.[176]

B-47 Stratojet

B-47 Stratojet
The Boeing B-47 Stratojet gets a secondary role in Paramount's 1955 film Strategic Air Command, starring James Stewart, as the new jet that is nothing like the old Convair B-36 he is used to.[177] The film features good aerial footage of both the B-47 and the B-36. The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, using aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing.[178]

Ejection seat testing of B-47s performed at Eglin AFB, Florida, in 1953 and 1954 as part of aeromedical research was recreated in the 1955 20th Century Fox film On the Threshold of Space starring Guy Madison,[179][180] and in a 1957 Pine-Thomas Productions drama Bailout at 43,000.[181][182]

B-52 Stratofortress

Boeing B-52 Stratofortress
The 1957 Karl Malden film Bombers B-52 gives a fictional account of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress's introduction into service at Castle Air Force Base.[186]

The 1963 film A Gathering of Eagles focuses on the stresses of a B-52 wing commander at the height of the Cold War. Some excellent visuals of the B-52 including a complex inflight refueling operation which nearly ends in disaster.[187][188]

The B-52 was also a key part of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 black comedy film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.[189]

A B-52 was a focal point of the 1983 novel Trinity's Child, by William Prochnau, and the 1990 telemovie adaptation, By Dawn's Early Light.[190]

B-58 Hustler
The Convair B-58 Hustler appeared in the 1964 film Fail Safe, where stock footage of B-58s was used to represent the fictional "Vindicator" bombers that attack Moscow.[17] The art used in the original magazine publication of the novel had depicted the "Vindicator" bombers – a recycling of the name of a World War II American dive bomber – as nearly identical to B-58s, but equipped with canards.[191] This would have given the fictional bombers the appearance of the canceled B-58B.

Bede BD-5J Acrostar
James Bond uses the little Bede BD-5J Acrostar jet to escape from an army base in an unidentified Latin American country at the beginning of the 1983 film Octopussy. The jet had been hidden in a horse trailer, pulled by a Range Rover.[192]

Bell UH-1 Iroquois

Bell UH-1 Iroquois in South Vietnam in 1966
The Bell UH-1 Iroquois (commonly called the Huey) was the most common helicopter during the Vietnam War, as an aircraft used to insert and remove troops from the field, transport casualties for medical treatment and as a gunship.[211] As such, it has appeared in many works of fiction related to the war.

The UH-1 was an important part of the 1968 film The Green Berets. The production company paid $18,623.64 for the material, the eighty-five hours of flying time by UH-1 helicopters, and thirty-eight hundred man-days for military personnel taken away from their regular duties.[212]

Two UH-1H Hueys make up part of the attack package on Ernst Stavro Blofeld's oil rig command center at the climax of the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever.[205]

The UH-1 was in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Several Hueys were rented from the Philippine Air Force.[213] The distinct and iconic sound of the helicopters was featured prominently in the film's sound design of the soundtrack.[214]

de Havilland Vampires feature in the 1954 British motion picture Conflict of Wings, a drama about the conflict that arises when an RAF squadron based in Norfolk is allocated a small island to use as a range for low-level attack training only to encounter the protests of nearby villagers who want the island preserved as a bird sanctuary.[344]

Vampires also feature in the 1966 novel Shooting Script by former RAF pilot and thriller writer Gavin Lyall.[345]

The Vampire is central to the plot of the 1975 novella, The Shepherd by British novelist Frederick Forsyth, the story of an RAF pilot attempting to fly home for Christmas from RAF Celle, Germany, to RAF Lakenheath on Christmas Eve 1957. The fact that the DH.100 was not fitted with ejection seats until about ten years later, and hence was a major challenge to bail out of, is an important element of the story.[346]

Douglas DC-2
Douglas DC-2, PH-AJU, "Uiver", race number 44, was depicted by Douglas DC-3, VH-ANR, in the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, about the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Trophy Air Race.[227] It is also known as Half a World Away.[228]

A Douglas DC-3A of Central Airlines appears in the 1954 film Strategic Air Command as the transport that conveys a security check team into Carswell AFB, Texas.[347]

The 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone entitled "The Arrival" features a DC-3 on Flight 107, which arrives at its destination with no one on board. It originally aired 22 September 1961.[348]

The chief character of the 1965 novel High Citadel by Desmond Bagley is an alcoholic former Korean War fighter pilot who flies a Douglas DC-3 for a small airline in a fictional Andean country in South America. He is forced at gunpoint by his co-pilot—a Communist agent—to crash-land the DC-3 at a remote abandoned mine in the Andes so that Communists planning a coup can capture and kill a politician travelling as a passenger.[349]

A DC-3 starred in the 1982 British television series Airline. The aircraft used to depict the DC-3 of the fictional Ruskin Air Services was also used in the 1980s television series Tenko and the 2001 series Band of Brothers.[350][351]

In the 1985 two-part episode of the television series Magnum, P.I. entitled All For One, the four main characters (Thomas, Rick, T.C. and Higgins) fly from Hawai'i to Cambodia in a DC-3 (c/n N162E) to carry out a personal mission. Several scenes are filmed both inside and outside of this aircraft.[352]

In the 1989 comedy film Major League, the hard-luck Cleveland Indians baseball team is "upgraded" to a DC-3 for their transportation to away games.[353]

In the 1994 film Richie Rich, the Rich family own and pilot a DC-3, named "Billion Dollar One", which crashes in the Atlantic due to a bomb on board.[354]

The DC-3 features in a chase scene in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace.[355]

The 2012 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television series Arctic Air features a Yellowknife-based airline that relies on DC-3s.[356]

The 2016 film Rules Don't Apply features a DC-3 in two sequences on land and one in air. Howard Hughes pilots the DC-3 in a risky manner while two other passengers are aboard, shutting off the engines in-air and performing a "proper glide".[357]

Douglas DC-4

The Douglas DC-4 appears in the Ernest K. Gann novel The High and the Mighty. A former USAF Douglas C-54 Skymaster operated by Transocean Airlines portrayed the Douglas DC-4 in the 1954 film of the same name.[358] Ironically, this airframe was lost over the Pacific on 28 March 1964 with an engine fire just as depicted in the film. There were no survivors of the nine "souls on board" and the wreckage was never found.[359]

Douglas DC-8
In the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, a Douglas DC-8 is given false landing instructions by terrorists and crash lands in a blizzard, resulting in fatalities to all on board. Industrial Light and Magic used a 23-foot long model to shoot the effects of the crash and explosion. Filming was done at a remote airstrip in the Mojave Desert of California. "However, shots of the passengers' frightened reactions to the initial impact, which had been shot on a set and originally cut into the movie, were so terrifying (made all the more authentic by preproduction research of Federal Aviation Administration test crashes and data from real aircraft crashes) that they were ultimately cut before the film's release." ILM constructed five DC-8 models for the production.[246]

EB-66 Destroyer
The film Bat*21 featured an EB-66 variant of the Douglas B-66 Destroyer[360] being shot down over North Vietnam in the beginning of the film.

English Electric Lightning
The 1976 children's book Thunder and Lightnings by Jan Mark is about the relationship of two boys – otherwise outsiders – who share an interest in aeroplanes, in particular the English Electric Lightnings flown by the local squadron. The author was awarded the Carnegie Medal in 1978 for the book.[361][362]

Eurofighter Typhoon
A two RAF Eurofighter Typhoon was featured in the 2013 Marvel film Thor: The Dark World, to fire on the Ark. However, the jets were drawn in by the portals, transporting them to Vanaheim during the Battle of Greenwich.

Eurocopter Tiger
A Eurocopter EC665 Tiger attack helicopter has a starring role in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye.[363] On the 2002 Special Edition DVD, the director's commentary notes the aircraft's appearances in the film's Monte Carlo scenes were of a prototype Tiger provided by the French Navy along with its test platform, the frigate La Fayette (F710). Its other appearances throughout the rest of the film were special effects models.[364]

Three Eurocopter EC665 Tigers save the day in the 2017 film Rescue Under Fire.[312][313]

Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma
A Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma becomes the main protagonist of the film Rescue under fire. The unit used for filming in the movie was the same as in the real events.[312][313]

F2H Banshee
Protagonist Lt. Harry Brubaker flew a McDonnell F2H Banshee in the 1953 James A. Michener novel The Bridges at Toko-Ri. In the subsequent 1954 film adaptation, his aircraft was changed to a Grumman F9F Panther.[365]

F3F

Grumman F3F
Flight Command, released by MGM in 1940, featured the Grumman F3F, filmed at NAS North Island, San Diego, California. Aerial flying by Frank Clarke and Paul Mantz.[284]

The 1941 Warner Bros. film Dive Bomber showed Grumman F3Fs.[366] F3F-2, BuNo 0989, '6-F-4', of VF-6, assigned to USS Enterprise, is one of the best-known F3F-2's due to the fact it is the aircraft that Fred MacMurray "crashed" in this movie.[367] Filming began at NAS North Island, San Diego, California, on 20 March 1941.[368]

F-4 Phantom II
The Gobots character Mach 3 and the Transformers character Fireflight both turn into McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs.[314]

US Marine aviator Lt. Col. Wilbur "Bull" Meecham flew an F-4 Phantom II in the 1979 film The Great Santini starring Robert Duvall as Meecham.[369]

In the 1988 film Iron Eagle II, F-4s appear as Soviet MiGs. The aircraft were provided by the Israeli Air Force for the production.[370]

F4F Wildcat
Grumman F4F Wildcats were shown in the critical aerial battle scenes in the film Midway.[371]

F4U Corsair
The Vought F4U Corsair was a regularly featured aircraft of VMF-214 in the 1976–1978 television series Baa Baa Black Sheep, based on the experiences of Pappy Boyington. The series was later renamed Black Sheep Squadron.[372]

Computer-generated images of F4U Corsairs appear in the 2006 Second World War drama Flags of Our Fathers directed by Clint Eastwood.[373]

An F4U Corsair named Skipper Riley (voiced by Stacy Keach) is one of the characters in Disney's animated TV series and films "Air Mater" (2011), Planes (2013).[374]

F-5 Freedom Fighter/Tiger II
Northrop F-5s played the part of the fictional MiG-28 enemy aircraft in the 1986 film Top Gun.[20][375]

F5F Skyrocket
The sole Grumman XF5F-1 Skyrocket, which never entered production or squadron service, was incorporated as the primary mount for Blackhawk and the Blackhawk Squadron in wartime editions of the anthology series Military Comics published by Quality Comics, the first issue of which was published in August 1941. The long-running title was later acquired by DC Comics, with the squadron upgrading to more modern types.[376]

F6F Hellcat
Grumman F6F Hellcats appeared in the 1951 motion picture Flying Leathernecks directed by Nicholas Ray and starring John Wayne.[377] One of the pilots who flew aircraft for the aerial scenes in the production was Marine Captain Phil De Groot who, after completing work on the film, flew in the Korean War and was wounded in action. The production was filmed at a small airstrip at Camp Pendleton, California. De Groot said, "They put some sand all over the strip, and some palm trees, and built a little pagoda there, simulating Guadalcanal..."[378]

F6Fs appear in the 1964 novel The Last Tallyho by Richard Newhafer, a work inspired by the author's real-life experiences as a Hellcat pilot during WW2.[379]

F6Fs also feature in the 1978 novel Wingmen by Ensan Case, a novel depicting US Navy fighter pilots serving on a fictional aircraft carrier- the 'USS Constitution'. The carrier's fighter squadron- VF-20- takes part in the Pacific War 1943-1944 and it centres on the experiences of two of its members- ensign Fred Trusteau and the squadron-commander, Lt Jack Hardigan.[380]

Computer-generated images of F6F Hellcats appear in the 2002 Second World War drama Windtalkers directed by John Woo and starring Nicolas Cage.[381]

F9F Panther

Grumman F9F Panthers
The Grumman F9F-2 Panther was prominently featured in the 1954 films Men of the Fighting Lady and The Bridges at Toko-Ri, although the protagonist instead flew a McDonnell F2H Banshee in the 1953 novel of the same name on which the latter film was based.[365] Footage of the famous non-fatal F9F-5 Panther ramp strike accident that occurred on 23 June 1951 as Commander George Chamberlain Duncan attempted to land on USS Midway in BuNo 125228, in which the forward fuselage broke away and rolled down the deck, has been used in several films including Men of the Fighting Lady, Midway (1976), and The Hunt For Red October (1990).[382]

F11F Tiger
In Alas, Babylon, the post-apocalyptic 1959 novel by Pat Frank, a heat-seeking missile launched by a Grumman F11F Tiger that accidentally strikes the port area of Latakia, Syria, sets off secondary explosions and gives the Soviet Union the casus belli for preemptive nuclear strikes against the US.[383][verification needed]

F-14 Tomcat
The Grumman F-14 Tomcat was central to the 1986 film Top Gun.[42][384][385] The aviation-themed film was such a success in creating interest in naval aviation that the US Navy, which assisted with the film, set up recruitment desks outside some theaters.[386] Producers paid the US Navy $886,000 as reimbursement for flight time of aircraft in the film with an F-14 billed at $7,600 per flight hour.[21][375]

Two F-14As of VF-84 from the USS Nimitz appeared in the 1980 film The Final Countdown,[387] with four from the squadron in the 1996 release Executive Decision,[247] the Jolly Rogers' final film appearance before being disestablished. The military legal drama TV series JAG (1995–2005) featured lead character Harmon Rabb, a Tomcat pilot-turned-lawyer,[42] and the Tomcat was a central part of the Stephen Coonts novel Final Flight.[42]

The F-14 Tomcat is the primary focus of the 1987 Williams pinball machine "F-14 Tomcat".[388]

F-15 Eagle

An F-15J and F-15DJ of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force
The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is one of the most recognized modern fighters; this has led to, or perhaps even been aided by, its common use in children's toys. Leader-1 of the Gobots turns into an F-15.[389] The Transformers toy line and media have featured numerous characters who turn into F-15 Eagles, the most notable being the villain Starscream in 1984[390] and a group of similar Decepticons, the Seekers: Acid Storm, Thundercracker, Skywarp and Sunstorm. Although a completely unrelated design to the others, the Aerialbot Air Raid also disguises himself as an F-15.[391]

F-15s feature in the 1980 novel Eagles by M H Davis, a work which portrays pilots of the USAF.[392]

The F-15 is featured in the 1997 film Air Force One.[249] The Eagle was also shown in advertisements for the 2000 film Thirteen Days. The ads were withdrawn when it came to the attention of New Line Cinema that the F-15, which first flew in 1972, was out of place for a film set in 1962. This was problematic for New Line, who had termed the film a "by-the-numbers recreation" and "close to perfect." "Every ship, plane, truck and craft that moves in the film is absolutely authentic to the time period", said Steve Elzer, a spokesman for New Line. Mr. Elzer said the advertisement was created by an outside agency.[393]

F-15Js and F-15DJs appear prominently in the 2004 film ULTRAMAN. The film's protagonist, Shunichi Maki, is a prestigious pilot of the F-15, and encounters the enigmatic Ultraman 'The Next' while flying the aircraft.[394]

The F-15 has appeared in numerous video games, including the 1985 Microprose title F-15 Strike Eagle[395] and its two sequels, F-15 Strike Eagle II (1989)[396] and F-15 Strike Eagle III (1992).[397]

F-16 Fighting Falcon

F-16s of the USAF's Thunderbirds display team
The Transformers Aerialbot Skydive and Decepticon Dreadwind disguise themselves as F-16 Fighting Falcons.[398] The Transformers character Needlenose disguises himself as an F-16XL.[399]

The Falcon was one of the stars of the 1986 film Iron Eagle. The US Air Force refused to assist with production of the film because it found the plot about a teenager flying an F-16 into a foreign country to be "a little off the wall".[21]

The 1986 action-adventure romantic comedy film The Jewel of the Nile featured a brutal dictator's personal F-16 as the key element in the protagonists (played by Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas) escaping from a fortified town.[400]

The aircraft was also featured in the HBO 1992 production Afterburn. A dramatization of true events, the F-16 was the subject of a protracted legal battle over the safety of the design.[401]

The F-16 was featured in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears.[114]

Starting in 2007, the F-16 became one of two aircraft (along with the Cirrus SR22) to be featured in Google Earth Flight Simulator.[402]

F/A-18 Hornet
The McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet appears in the 1994 film Clear and Present Danger which was directed by Phillip Noyce. The jet drops a laser-guided bomb on a car at a drug lord's villa, being laser designated by a special forces team.[403]

In the 1996 Michael Bay-directed film The Rock, F/A-18s attack the prison on Alcatraz Island in the final scenes.[404]

The F/A-18 Hornet was prominently featured in the 1996 film Independence Day and was filmed using F/A-18 squadrons belonging to the 3rd Marine Corps Aircraft Wing at El Toro and Miramar, in California.[403]

F/A-18s successfully attack the famous Japanese monster Godzilla (ゴジラ |Gojira) with AGM-84 Harpoons in the 1998 remake film Godzilla.[403]

The updated two-seater F/A-18F Super Hornet variant was featured in the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines, directed by John Moore, and starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. The plot centers around a Super Hornet being shot down over Bosnia.[405]

The F/A-18 Hornet appeared briefly in the 2003 film Tears of the Sun in the final, climactic battle, helping to save the surviving SEAL team members.[406]

In the 2013 Disney animated film Planes, the characters Bravo and Echo are based on the F/A-18E Super Hornet.[407]

The F/A-18 Super Hornet is to be featured in the upcoming film, Top Gun: Maverick.[408]

F-20 Tigershark
The Northrop F-20 Tigershark appears a number of times in Kaoru Shintani's manga/animated franchise Area 88, as a personal unit of main character Shin Kazama.[409][410]

Although the F-20 never entered service, in Barrett Tillman's 1991 novel Warriors, the Royal Saudi Air Force orders over a hundred of them. The RSAF assigns the fighter to select pilots who graduate from a localized version of Top Gun established by former USAF and USN pilots. The bigger plot of the novel involves the Saudi pilots joining a pan-Arab attack against Israel.[411]

F-22 Raptor
The F-22 Raptor is heavily featured in the 1998 Stephen Coonts novel Fortunes of War.[412] This novel sees Japan invade Russia with a fictional airplane they developed called the "Zero". While not wanting to directly come to the aid of the Russians, the US lends a squadron of F-22 Raptors to the Russian Air Force and hires American pilots to fly as sworn-in members of the Russian military.

After appearing briefly in the 2003 Hulk film, the F-22 made its major Hollywood début in the 2007 film Transformers and its 2009 sequel[413] as the form taken by the Decepticon character Starscream in addition to numerous USAF fighters that engaged during the initial and climactic battles. The film crew was allowed to film actual Raptors in flight, unlike previous computer-generated appearances, because of the military's support of director Michael Bay. The Raptors were filmed at Edwards Air Force Base.[414] The real Raptor made its next big screen appearance in Iron Man, in which a Raptor call sign "Whiplash 1" lost its left wing during a mid-air collision with the Iron Man armor.[415]

Toys released for Starscream were replica F-22 Raptor models. These models were reused for other characters in the line, like Thundercracker, Skywarp and Ramjet, that also turned into F-22 Raptors.[416]

Although the live-action 2007 film Transformers made Starscream the best-known Transformer that turns into an F-22, there were other F-22 Transformers before it. For instance the 1997 Machine Wars versions of Megatron and Megaplex transformed into F-22s.[417]

In the 2013 film Olympus Has Fallen, computer animation was used to depict F-22 Raptors intercepting an armed AC-130 attacking Washington, D.C.; two F-22s are shot down before a third hits the AC-130 with a missile, causing it to crash.[293]

The plane is the subject of a flight-simulation video game, F-22 Interceptor, which was released by Electronic Arts and Ingram Entertainment for the Sega Mega Drive console in 1991.[418]

F-35 Lightning II

Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II
The first major film appearance of a representation of a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was 2006's Superman Returns. During this film, a pair of F-35A fighters escorted the modified Boeing 777 mothership for an experimental NASA spaceplane. This visualization was a combination of an actual cockpit and CGI for the aircraft in flight.[257]

The next major film appearance of an F-35 was in Live Free or Die Hard (released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America) in 2007. The film used a combination of a full-scale model and CGI effects.[419]

The Transformers character of the Autobot Breakaway and its redeco the Decepticon Thrust from the Revenge of the Fallen toy both disguise themselves as F-35s. Breakaway appears as a playable character in the 2009 Revenge of the Fallen video game.[420]

F-35s are depicted in the 2012 film The Avengers. The film was originally intended to include real F-35s, but the United States Department of Defense objected to the depiction of F-22s and F-35s as under the control of S.H.I.E.L.D., a covert, "extra-governmental" organization whose loyalties are unclear, so CGI aircraft were substituted instead.[421][422]

Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris fly F-35s in a simulated dogfight against the UCAVs Carol's company is trying to sell to the US Department of Defense in the 2011 film Green Lantern.[423]

A squadron of F-35s engages General Zod's ship in the 2013 film Man of Steel.[16]

F-84 Thunderjet, Thunderstreak
For the 1955 biographical film The McConnell Story about ace Joseph C. McConnell, eight Republic F-84s of the 614th Fighter-Bomber Squadron donned dark blue paint with red stars to portray MiG-15s doing mock battle for the cameras with F-86 Sabres of the 366th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, both units based at Alexandria AFB, Louisiana. Air Defense Command headquarters notified its pilots in January 1955 that the mock MiGs would be operating over portions of the southwestern US.[424]

F-86 Sabre
The North American F-86 Sabre appears in the 1956 novel The Hunters by James Salter,[425] and in the 1958 film of the same name, set in Korea, features North American F-86 Sabres.[426]

F-86s appear in the 1959 novel MiG Alley by Robert Eunson which portrays a pilot Captain Homer 'Mac' McCullough who flies F-86s during the Korean War and is frustrated at being forbidden to engage enemy MiGs beyond the Yalu River.[427]

Desmond Bagley's 1965 novel High Citadel features F-86 Sabres, which make up the frontline equipment of the air force of the fictional South American country in which the book is set. There are four squadrons of Sabres; two are loyal to the current corrupt government; one is secretly loyal to a reformist politician who is returning from exile to take over the country; and the fourth is secretly loyal to Communist forces who are attempting to kill the politician. The latter part of the novel features a dogfight between a Sabre flown by one of the main characters—a CIA agent and former Sabre pilot who fought in the Korean War—and aircraft of the Communist squadron.[349]

F-86F Sabres of the JASDF regularly feature in the Showa era of kaiju films produced by Toho, with the aircraft appearing most prominently during a sequence in Godzilla where two Sabres attack the titular monster after he leaves the devastated city of Tokyo.[428]

In the 1981 dystopian film The Last Chase, retired pilot J.G. Williams (played by Burgess Meredith) and his F-86 Sabre play the antagonist in attempting to track down and destroy the protagonist Franklyn Hart (played by Lee Majors). After becoming sympathetic to Hart's cause, Williams sacrifices himself in a kamikaze-style attack against a laser installation to protect Hart.[429]

A Sabre plays an important role in the 1999 film comedy Blast from the Past which stars Brendan Fraser and Christopher Walken. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Sabre pilot is forced to eject over a residential area in the US and the aircraft just happens to crash onto the house of an eccentric father who is sheltering with his family in a large underground bomb shelter he has constructed. Believing the crash to be the impact of a nuclear bomb, the family remain underground for 35 years.[430]

There is a short scenario in the 1999 animated action adventure, The Iron Giant, in which the US military sends out three F-86 Sabres in attempt to "rescue" Hogarth by shooting down the giant who was holding Hogarth in his hands. The Sabres begin their chase when the giant runs away from the town, but then encounters by a school bus, causing him to trip and fall of a cliff, with the Sabre pilots assuming that he had fallen to his death. But then soon afterwards, he ascends into the air due to rockets implanted in his feet. The Sabres then pursue the giant and have trouble following him, until finally shooting him down with an unguided missile.[431]

F-101 Voodoo

McDonnell F-101B Voodoo
A pair of McDonnell F-101B Voodoos fly over the Russian submarine Спрут at the end of the 1966 comedy The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, directed by Norman Jewison. Although the film is set in New England, it was filmed on the West Coast and the fighters were from the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at the now-closed Hamilton Air Force Base, California.[432]

F-104 Starfighter
Gen. Charles "Chuck" Yeager's 10 December 1963 flying accident during a test flight in a modified rocket-boosted Lockheed NF-104A Starfighter was featured in The Right Stuff motion picture. The aircraft used for filming was a standard German Luftwaffe F-104G, flying with its wingtip fuel tanks removed; it otherwise lacked any of the NF-104A's modifications, most visibly the rocket engine pod at the base of the vertical stabilizer.[433]

The F-104 is featured heavily in the 1964 film The Starfighters, directed by Will Zens and starring future US Congressman Bob Dornan. The film later appeared on the Comedy Central series Mystery Science Theater 3000 as the subject of episode #612.[434]

Footage of an F-104 featured in the opening scenes of the science-fiction motion picture The Bamboo Saucer (1968), playing the role of an experimental jet called the "X-109" whose pilot Fred Norwood (John Ericson) encounters a UFO while carrying out a test flight.[435]

An F-104 made regular appearances on the 1960s television sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Leading man Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), a pilot in the US Air Force, was often to be seen landing and climbing out of the cockpit of an F-104A. That particular aircraft – 56-817 – later became part of the collection of the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, Oahu, Hawaii.[436]

Italian Air Force F-104 Starfighters starred in several episodes of the 1989 Italian public television RAI Due fiction series Aquile, which tells the story of a group of Italian Air Force cadets going through training in the Accademia Aeronautica of Pozzuoli (near Naples).[437]

The 2015 German film Starfighter – Sie wollten den Himmel erobern ("they wanted to conquer heaven") tells the story of the investigation about its accidents in West Germany.[438]

Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters is a 1974 satirical concept album by Robert Calvert and others, telling an absurdly fictionalized tale of the F-104G's acquisition by and service with the German Air Force[439]

F-117 Nighthawk

Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk
The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was the subject of the 1991 MicroProse game F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0[68] and the 1993 Sega Mega Drive-exclusive F-117 Night Storm.[440]

The F-117 Nighthawk was the subject of the 1992 Hollywood film Interceptor;[441] the plot centres on an attempt to steal two F-117s from the cargo hold of a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.

Fairchild UC-61 Forwarder
A former US Army Air Force Fairchild UC-61A Forwarder, painted in USAAF colours, makes a brief appearance to represent the Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman in which big band leader Glenn Miller disappeared in December 1944, in the 1954 Universal International Pictures film The Glenn Miller Story.[442]

The same aircraft was also featured in a 1964 episode of Michael Bentine's BBC TV comedy programme, It's a Square World, about a shoestring airline with a staff of two. Filming took a day at Elstree Aerodrome, Herts. In 1965, it appeared in an episode of the ITV programme, The Moonraker.[442]

Fairchild Hiller FH-227
When the Fairchild Hiller FH-227D operating as Uruguayan Air Force (Fuerza Aérea Uruguaya) Flight 571 T-571 crashed in the Argentine Andes on 13 October 1972, it began a tale of amazing human survival for the 16 of the 45 on board who were rescued over two months later, after two passengers walked to civilization. The survivors' story was published in Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, a critically acclaimed book by Piers Paul Read, in 1974. When the story was filmed in 1992 as Alive, directed by Frank Marshall, a similar FH-227 marked as the doomed aircraft was used for some shots, while Industrial Light and Magic depicted the crash using an eight-foot breakaway model, designed to shear at mid-fuselage. The nose and tail were heavily reinforced while a non-reinforced midsection was built up of plastic, foil, wires and metals so that when it broke it would have the layered metal look of a real airframe breaking up. A cable system was rigged to fly the model, which was on an aligned track, into the miniature mountain, hitting the "sweet spot" on the fuselage, a weakened area barely three inches long.[443]

Fairey Fox
The Fairey Fox I, G-ACXO, race number 35, which participated in the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Trophy Air Race, was portrayed in the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, also known as Half a World Away,[228] by an unlikely Boeing Stearman.[227]

Fairey Swordfish

Fairey Swordfish
Two Fairey Swordfish starred in the 1960 film Sink the Bismarck!. Swordfish LS326 was marked as "5A" of 825 Naval Air Squadron, while NF389 was marked as LS423 / "5B".[444]

Focke-Wulf Fw 190
Focke-Wulf Fw 190s feature in the 1970 novel Betrayed Skies by Rudolf Braunburg which depicts a Luftwaffe fighter unit based in Poland in 1944.[445]

Modified North American T-6 Texans portrayed Focke-Wulf Fw 190s in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far.[75]

A new-build Fw 190 A-8/N participated in the 2007 Finnish war film Tali-Ihantala 1944, painted in the same markings as Oberst Erich Rudorffer's aircraft in 1944.[446]

Fw 190s feature in the French graphic novel The Grand Duke (2012) written by Yann, illustrated by Romain Hugault and depicting aerial combat between the Soviet air force and the German Luftwaffe over the Eastern Front in the latter stages of the Second World War.[447]

Focke-Wulf Triebflügel

Several Lockheed L-1011 TriStars were depicted in the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, with two large models constructed by Industrial Light and Magic "flown" on wires for the cameras through "storm clouds" made of non-toxic vaporized mineral oil. Filming was done at a remote airstrip in the Mojave Desert in California. Whipped by the Santa Ana winds coming through the Tehachapi Pass into the valley, the smoke effect contributed convincing heavy weather to the shots.[246]

The Lockheed L-1011 Tristar was featured in the 1992 film Passenger 57 as the location of a terrorist hijacking[573]. The aircraft, registration N330EA, was formerly operated commercially by Eastern Airlines and was painted in the livery of the fictional airline Atlantic International for the film.[574]

Although a Boeing 777 is mentioned as aircraft for the ill-fated Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 central to the ABC television series Lost, the fuselage used to represent the wreckage on the beach was a Lockheed L-1011-385 formerly operated by Delta Airlines.[258][576]

Lockheed T-33 T-Bird
A Lockheed T-33, the trainer version of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star, appeared in the 1955 science-fiction film This Island Earth. In one of the early scenes of the film, the hero scientist Cal (played by Rex Reason) is about to land his T-33 at the desert airfield near his government-owned laboratory when the aircraft becomes ensnared by some unknown alien force. The film achieved renewed fame when it was spoofed in the 1996 comedy Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie.[577]

A T-33 played the role of a Soviet "Yak-12" in the 1957 Cold War romantic/drama Jet Pilot which starred John Wayne and Janet Leigh and was directed by Howard Hughes.[578]

27 Spanish Hispano Aviación HA-1112 M1L 'Buchon' single-engined fighters, Messerschmitt Bf 109s built under license in Spain, were used in the 1969 film Battle of Britain. The Buchons were altered to look more like correct Bf 109Es, adding mock machine guns and cannon, redundant tailplane struts, and removing the rounded wingtips.[589]

Computer-generated images of Bf 109Gs appear in the 2012 Second World War aerial film Red Tails directed by Anthony Hemingway and produced by Lucasfilm.[590]

During the attack, Pilot Officer 'Septic' Baird (John Gregson), although not yet an operational pilot, runs to a spare Hawker Hurricane fighter and takes off. He engages and shoots down a Bf-110 over the airfield and is later seen proudly inspecting the crashed aircraft although Baird is later reprimanded by his CO because during the battle, he carelessly left his radio stuck on 'transmit', preventing other pilots from communicating.[592] The Messerschmitt used in the film was a captured Bf-110G-4 which was later scrapped after filming.[593]

Messerschmitt Me 262

Messerschmitt Me 262 replica
The American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult portrayed a Messerschmitt Me 262A on the cover of their third album Secret Treaties (1974). The album also contains a song, "Me 262", written from the point of view of a Luftwaffe pilot on a bomber interception mission in April 1945.[594]

In W. E. B. Griffin's 1999 novel Secret Honor, Luftwaffe Major Hans-Peter von Wachstein is checked out in the Me 262 by General Adolf Galland while in Nazi Germany.[595]

In the 2000 alternate history novel Fox on the Rhine, by Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson, the Luftwaffe, under Adolf Galland's command, prioritizes the development of the Me 262. A number of squadrons are used to maul a heavy bomber raid in concert with other, propeller-driven, fighters, but worker sabotage of the engines affects their operational performance.[596]

In the second and last issue of the 2001 DC Vertigo miniseries Enemy Ace: War in Heaven, lead character Hans von Hammer leads a Luftwaffe flight against USAAF bomber formations with him piloting a scarlet red Me 262 that has no swastika tail insignia. Seeing the hopelessness of the war, he and his men later destroy the remaining 262s in their control before surrendering to a US Army unit.[597]

Me 262s feature in the 2012 Second World War film, Red Tails, directed by Anthony Hemingway.[598]

MiGs (generic)
As was common in the 1950s, "MiGs" (presumably −15s, as the story is set in Korea) appear in the 1956 novel The Hunters by James Salter about USAF fighter pilots.[425] As was common in the 1950s, the MiGs are portrayed by Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks in the 1958 film The Hunters[426]

More recently the part of MiGs has been played on screen by the F-5 Tiger II in 1986's Top Gun[20][375] and the 1998 JAG episode 3.24.[599]

MiGs feature in the 2007 novel Ascent by UK author Jed Mercurio, a fictional work about a Soviet pilot Yefgeni Yeremin covertly flying MiGs during the Korean War.[600] The book was later adapted into a graphic novel in 2011, illustrated by Wesley Robins.[601]

The aircraft also appeared in the 2006 film Blood Diamond, directed by Edward Zwick; it was used by the protagonist to reach a refugee camp.[604]

An Mil Mi-8 helicopter features in a major sequence in the 2019 Netflix film Triple Frontier directed by J C Chandor and starring Ben Affleck.[606]

Mi-8s appear in the 2019 HBO mini-series Chernobyl.[607] Mi-8s were among the Soviet helicopters used to firefight and monitor the exploded reactor in 1986.[608] In the series, helicopters are seen dropping sand-bags onto the fire and one helicopter is destroyed in a crash. The series portrays the incident as taking place shortly after the initial explosion at the reactor but in reality, the crash occurred some weeks later.[609]

Mil Mi-24 'Hind'

Mil Mi-24 helicopters
A Mil Mi-24 helicopter appears in the 1997 film Air Force One. The aircraft is used to retrieve a Russian prisoner in exchange for the US President, who is being held captive.[204]

It is featured numerous times in the Metal Gear video game series, starting from the 1987 MSX original.[610] Its appearance as a boss battle in the 1998 game Metal Gear Solid is probably the most famous instance.[611][612][613][614][615][616]

The helicopter is used extensively in the 2005 film The 9th Company, which fictionally depicts the Battle for Hill 3234 where Soviet Army paratroopers defend their post against Mujahideen fighters.

Grounded for investigation, the problem was traced to shoddy workmanship at the Mecklenburg factory where defective wood spars, water damage to glued parts, and pins carelessly splintering the members instead of securing them were discovered. Upon return to service two months later, the design was renamed the Fokker D.VIII in an effort to avoid the type's reputation as a killer.[624][625]

P-40

Curtiss P-40 Warhawks
In the 1942 John Wayne film Flying Tigers, real Curtiss P-40 Warhawks are featured. A New York Times critic called the P-40s "the true stars" of the film.[645] Republic Studios also built replicas for the film due to material shortages during the war. These can be identified by the fairings hiding the cylinder heads of the automotive V-8 engines installed in them, and the lack of elevators on the horizontal stabilizer.[646]

Future US President Ronald Reagan appears in the Recognition of the Japanese Zero Fighter (training film, 1942) as a young pilot learning to recognize the difference between a P-40 and a Japanese Zero.

The Steven Spielberg film Empire of the Sun (1987), based on the J.G. Ballard novel of the same name, featured models and restored Mustangs in an attack against a Japanese internment camp. This was the most complex and elaborately staged sequence of the film, requiring over 10 days of filming and 60 hours of aerial footage of Mustangs. Film historians and reviewers regard the scene as a significant cinematic achievement: "Spielberg's most emotionally reverberant moment, and one of the rare movie scenes that can truly be called epiphanies."[659]

The replica was constructed by engineer and pilot Charles Boddington who was later killed during the making of the 1971 film Von Richthofen & Brown. His son Matthew recently rebuilt the aircraft (after it was badly damaged in an accidental crash in the US) and it flew again at Sywell aerodrome, UK, in 2011.[684]

A Douglas SBD Dauntless was used in the production of the 1976 motion picture Midway. An SBD-5, which had formerly served in the RNZAF and which was (in 1976) non-airworthy and wingless, was used in the filming of the cockpit close-ups for actors such as Charlton Heston.[690][691]

Later in 1987, the same aircraft (BuNo 28536), now in airworthy condition, was used in the production of the epic 1988–1989 TV mini-series War & Remembrance. The aircraft appeared in the sequence depicting the Battle of Midway and during filming, was flown off the USS Lexington the first time an SBD had taken off from a carrier in 42 years.[692]

SB2C Helldiver / A-25 Shrike
The loss of a US Navy Curtiss SB2C-1 Helldiver, BuNo 00154, of VB-5, during launch near Trinidad on 28 May 1943[693] during the shakedown cruise of the USS Yorktown was incorporated by 20th Century Fox into the 1944 film Wing and a Prayer: The Story of Carrier X.[694]

Two USAAF Curtiss RA-25A Shrikes collided during a flypast for an air show near Spokane, Washington, on 23 July 1944, the accident filmed by a Paramount Pictures newsreel crew. This footage was used in the 1956 film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, apparently being shot down by a saucer.[695]

Many details about the aircraft looks, performance and procedures are given throughout the book, and as almost the entirety of the book is set inside Sunderlands, the warplane practically becomes a character. Other aircraft, both from Allied and German origin, are also featured and metioned.[696][697]

A Short Sunderland was the setting for much of the 1980 novel The Flying Porcupine by Richard Haligon. The novel takes its title from a nickname reputedly given to the Sunderland by German pilots thanks to its defensive armament of as many as 16 machine guns.[698]

Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King
CIA officer Jack Ryan (played by Alec Baldwin) is flown from an aircraft carrier to the submarine USS Dallas in a Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King in the 1990 film Hunt for Red October, based on the Tom Clancy's novel of the same title.[208]

A Chickasaw was furnished by the 48th Air Rescue Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida, for seven days of filming at Alexandria AFB, Louisiana, in February 1955.[700]

The character of "Harold the Helicopter" from the British children's program Thomas the Tank Engine is based on the Sikorsky S-55, built in the UK as the Westland Whirlwind.[701]

The Sikorsky S-55 appeared in Irwin Allen's 1960 film, The Lost World.[702]

The book, Retreat Hell, by W. E. B. Griffin, takes place in Korea during the Korean War. It centers on the use of a Sikorsky H-19A helicopter during the fall of 1950. Much of the action is driven forward by the abilities of the helicopter.[703]

A HH-53B Sea Stallion appears in the 1974 film Airport 1975, where a pilot is lowered on a tether from the helicopter to a damaged Boeing 747 in flight.[705]

The HH-53C variant was used in the combined combat search and rescue and VIP delivery sequences in the 1982 Malpaso Productions spy and action film Firefox,[706] produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood, based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Craig Thomas.

The Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion appears in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears, based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same title.[114]

A CH-53E Super Stallion is featured in the 1997 film The Jackal, where it flies over Washington D.C. and hovers between buildings during a fast rope sequence.[62]

The Sikorsky MH-53J is featured in the 2007 Transformers film as the alternate mode of Blackout. Production designer Jeff Mann stated "the Pave Low looks butch... the size made it the logical choice."[707] Toys for Blackout were MH-53 replicas, which were reused for the characters of Evac, Spinister and Whirl.[708]

The heavier CH-53E Super Stallion is the alternate form for the Decepticon Grindor in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[709]

The Sikorsky MH-53 appears in the 2009 video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, referred to simply as the "Pave Low".[710]

Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe/Sikorsky S-64
In the 1996 film Independence Day a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane is fitted with an array of flashing lights to communicate with an alien spaceship.[70]

Igor Sikorsky's Sikorsky S-29-A, previously owned by Roscoe Turner, doubled for a Gotha bomber in Howard Hughes' 1930 aerial epic Hell's Angels.[713] It was destroyed during filming. At the time of the aircraft's demise it had flown 500,000 miles.[714]

Sikorsky S-38
Replicas of the Sikorsky S-38 were used in the filming of the 2004 Martin Scorsese biopic of Howard Hughes, The Aviator.[715][716]

Sikorsky VS-44
When MGM produced the 1959 film The Gallant Hours, based on the life of US Navy Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, the studio rented a Sikorsky VS-44A, N41881, named "Mother Goose", from Catalina Air Lines, Inc., and painted it in wartime camouflage to depict a secret flight that Halsey had made to the South Pacific in a Consolidated PB2Y-1 Coronado. Although the studio had promised to repaint the flying boat after the production, this did not happen, and the airline had to restore the civilian livery itself.[717]

Sopwith Camel replica
The First World War Sopwith Camel fighter features prominently in the Biggles stories of W. E. Johns such as the collections: The Camels Are Coming (1932),[718] and Biggles of the Camel Squadron (1934).[719]

The 1934 novel Winged Victory by Victor M. Yeates features the Sopwith Camel in action during the Great War.[720]

In the 1975 George Roy Hill film The Great Waldo Pepper, the title character, flying a Camel, takes part in a dogfight with a Fokker Dr.I.[721]

Sopwith Camels feature in the 2013 novel A Splendid Little War by Derek Robinson which depicts a fictional RAF unit – Merlin Squadron – flying Camels in support of the White forces during the Russian Civil War in 1919.[722]

Sopwith 1½ Strutter

Shuttles are also used by US Marine forces who help Bond to eventually destroy the station and foil Drax's plans.[726]

In Payne Harrison's 1990 novel Storming Intrepid, the shuttle Intrepid – one of four new shuttles built by the US government – is hijacked by its mission commander, who is a Russian agent. The plot revolves around American efforts to prevent the agent from landing the shuttle in the USSR with its advanced SDI system intact.[727]

In the 2000 film Space Cowboys, four retired astronauts launch into space aboard the shuttle Daedalus to repair a crippled Russian satellite.[728]

In Jon Amiel's 2003 film The Core space shuttle Endeavour is sent off course by a disruption in the Earth's magnetic field, forcing it to land in the concrete-lined channel of the Los Angeles River.[728]

In the 2013 film Gravity, space shuttle Explorer is destroyed by an out of control satellite in the early portion of the film.[729]

SPAD
The 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured a SPAD S.VII among many types depicting World War I aircraft.[328]

Race Bannon, flying a SPAD S.XIII, fights a dogfight with a Fokker D.VII, flown by Baron Heinrich von Frohleich in Episode 10 of Jonny Quest, "Shadow of the Condor", first aired 20 November 1964.[456]

In Payne Harrison's 1990 novel Storming Intrepid, the US deploys an SR-71 over the USSR on an ELINT mission to record communications between the hijacked shuttle Intrepid and Soviet commanders on the ground. The Soviet air defenses attempt to shoot down the aircraft as it tries to get out of Soviet airspace. The aircraft briefly flames out, but successfully recovers and narrowly escapes a missile trap by MiG-31 interceptors.[727]

Although already retired from service for around a decade at the time of the film's release, the SR-71 Blackbird appears in the form of the character Jetfire, an over-the-hill Transformer near the end of its days, in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and its toy line.[731]

Supermarine Spitfire

Supermarine Spitfire Mk.VB
Along with the Hawker Hurricane,[508] the Supermarine Spitfire fighter is very strongly linked to the Battle of Britain in summer 1940, where the Royal Air Force fought the German Luftwaffe over the skies of Britain for air superiority.[507] As such it has been featured in many works of fiction related to the Battle of Britain.

The 1942 film The First of the Few is a dramatization of the life of R. J. Mitchell, mostly concerning his work on the Supermarine Spitfire.[738][739]

The 1951 film Malta Story centered around Spitfires and their pilots defending Malta in 1942.[740]

A clipped-wing Spitfire features in the opening sequence of David Lean's 1952 film The Sound Barrier (released in the US as Breaking the Sound Barrier). In the scene, which takes place over Dover in 1945, the Spitfire's pilot Philip Peel (John Justin) dives his aircraft at such a high speed, that he encounters a 'barrier' of dense air, causing such severe buffeting that he almost loses control of his machine.[343]

British writer Elleston Trevor's best-selling 1955 novel Squadron Airborne depicted a fictional RAF squadron flying Spitfires at the height of the Battle of Britain in 1940.[741]

A Spitfire IXc was one of at least two used in the production of the 1962 World War II epic film The Longest Day. The same aircraft also appeared in Von Ryan's Express (1965), Night of the Generals (1967), and Battle of Britain (1969).[742][743]

In John Frankenheimer's 1964 film, The Train, a Royal Air Force Spitfire is shown attempting to shoot up a locomotive traveling light on the French railway system, which gains safety in a tunnel.[744]

The Spitfire was a central part of the 1969 Guy Hamilton-directed film Battle of Britain, a fictionalized account of the real Battle of Britain that one critic called "the definitive depiction of war in the air".[511] The film led to an increase in the popularity of the aircraft among collectors of warbirds. According to one property dealer the appearance "did for Spitfires what the James Bond films did for the Aston Martin."[745] Producers secured 35 Spitfires for use in the film.[511]

A Spitfire Mk. IXc (MH434/G-ASJV) depicted an aerial reconnaissance variant in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far.[75]

A Spitfire (MH434/G-ASJV again) appears in a low-flying sequence in John Boorman's 1987 film Hope and Glory.[746][747][748]

The Spitfire was also the main aircraft used in the 1988 miniseries Piece of Cake. The series was based on a novel by the same name. Pilots in the novel flew the Hawker Hurricane, but the lack of airworthy Hurricanes forced the producers to change aircraft types, using five privately owned airworthy Spitfires and a collection of static and taxiing replicas.[749]

Real-life World War II RAF ace Douglas Bader was portrayed as a night-flying Spitfire pilot during The Blitz in the animated Disney series Gargoyles second-season episode "M.I.A", and was saved from losing his life in air combat by Goliath and by Griff, a British gargoyle of the London Clan.[750]

The 2001 Czech film Dark Blue World, a World War II drama about Czech pilots who flew with the Royal Air Force directed by Jan Svěrák, featured Spitfires. The vintage Spitfires cost the film-makers US$7,500 an hour to use. The aerial sequences were a combination of live aerial footage, CGI and out-takes from the 1969 film The Battle of Britain.[751]

The film Pearl Harbor (2001), directed by Michael Bay, included a sequence which featured Spitfires.[752][753]

A Spitfire Mk Vb featured in at least three episodes of the British ITV television series Foyle's War (2002–2015). The central character Detective Foyle has a son Andrew, who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during WW2. One episode to feature the Spitfire was Among the Few in season 2 where one of Andrew's fellow pilots is revealed to be a secret homosexual and guilty of manslaughter.[754]

Spitfires starred in the 2006 seven-minute short film/commercial Pilots produced by the Swiss-German watch manufacturer IWC Schaffhausen to promote its Big Pilot's Watch Collection. John Malkovich featured in the film.[755]

The more recent novel Band of Eagles (2007) by Frank Barnard featured Spitfires engaged in the defence of Malta in 1941.[756]

Two vintage Spitfires were used in the filming of the 2010 BBC television docu-drama First Light, based on the memoir of the same name by Second World War RAF pilot Geoffrey Wellum.[757]

A Spitfire features in the 2011 animated short film Paths of Hate by Polish film-maker Damian Nenow, a war and supernatural horror film in which two fighter pilots fight a vicious duel to the death.[758] The film was short-listed for best short film at the 2012 Academy Awards.[759]

UFM Easy Riser
The UFM Easy Riser was one of two ultralight aircraft that lead the Canada geese south in the 1996 film Fly Away Home. The film was a highly fictionalized account based on Bill Lishman's autobiography and work with Operation Migration, but both Lishman's real-life migratory experiments teaching birds to migrate and the film used the Easy Riser, due to its low cruising speed, which allowed the birds to pace the aircraft in flight.[762][763]

USS Macon
In the 1934 Warner Bros. film Here Comes the Navy, directed by Lloyd Bacon, the first of nine films in which James Cagney and Pat O'Brien appeared together, the US Navy dirigible USS Macon (ZRS-5) is shown late in the production after Cagney's character transfers to a lighter-than-air unit after a falling out with his shipmates aboard the USS Arizona.[764]

Vickers FB5 Gunbus

Vickers FB5
A replica Vickers FB5 was constructed to appear in the 1986 film Sky Bandits (also released under the title Gunbus) which was about a pair of cowboys who flee the US to escape prison for a bank robbery and end up serving in the RFC during the Great War. The replica, built as a taxiing prop for the film, is currently housed at Sywell Aerodrome in the UK.[765]

A Vickers Wellington features in the 1961 comedy film Very Important Person (released in the US as A Coming Out Party). In the film, the central character, a military scientist named Sir Ernest Pease (James Robertson Justice) is taken over Germany during WW2 in order to test a top-secret apparatus. However the Wellington is hit by anti-aircraft fire and Pease is sucked out through a hole in the fuselage, parachuting into enemy territory and ending up in a POW camp.[770]

The 1968 Czechoslovak film Nebeští jezdci (Sky Riders) about Czechoslovak airmen in RAF Bomber Command featured a Vickers Wellington.[771] It was depicted by a taxiing replica based on an extensively modified Lisunov Li-2. Flight sequences were shot with large scale replicas and the film also incorporated wartime stock footage, including scenes from Target for Tonight.[772]

A haunted Vickers Wellington is the subject of Robert Westall's macabre, and critically appreciated, 1982 short story Blackham's Wimpy.[773]

Irish graphic novelist Garth Ennis chose the Wellington to be the aircraft flown by the Australian crew of RAF Bomber Command in his 2010 graphic novel Happy Valley, set in 1942 during the early phase of the night bombing offensive and one of his Battlefields series.[774]

V-22 Osprey
In the 2005 TV miniseries The Triangle, V-22 Ospreys armed with torpedoes confront and sink the protagonists' boat on the ocean as they approach the exclusion zone around the temporal phenomenon.[69]

Two Bell-Boeing CV-22 Ospreys (of only three in the USAF inventory at the time)[775] were filmed in flight at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, in May 2006 for the 2007 Transformers film.[776][777] This would inspire a host of Transformers toys and characters based on the Osprey including the Decepticons Incinerator and Ruination as well as the Autobots Springer and Blades.[778]

The 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon features the CV-22 Osprey.[779]

Wallis Autogyro
Developed in the 1960s by former RAF Wing Commander Ken Wallis, the Wallis WA-116 Agile was an improved, more stable autogyro design. Following a prototype, five WA-116s were built by Beagle Aircraft at Shoreham, three of which were for evaluation by the British Army Air Corps.[780] In 1966, one of the Beagle-built WA-116s, registered G-ARZB, was modified for use in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, dubbed "Little Nellie" and flown by Wallis, doubling for Sean Connery's 007.[781]
